The main thread listens on the port and puts every new connection into a `waiting_clients` list. When two sockets are available, the main thread pops them, groups them as a pair, and starts ï¼š
    	threading.Thread(target=handle_game,
          args=(Game(p1, p2),),
          daemon=True).start()

That thread runs the entire 26-round war protocol for its two players
 and then closes both sockets. Only the main thread touches `waiting_clients`; each game thread uses its own local data, so no locks are required.  

Result: the server can run many games in parallel without blocking.
